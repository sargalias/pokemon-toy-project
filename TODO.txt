Fix some TypeScript hacks.
    Need to fix prismaPokemonRepository and remove the cast to unknown.
    In the SortBy React component, don't explicitly cast the types. Use a type guard instead.
Maybe use enums for types and stats in the database?
Where to do sorting and filtering:
    Best is probably FE (Next.js) because we already give it all the data.
    But do it based on URL parameters so a user can revisit a particular URL.
Front end usability and performance:
    Don't show everything for 150 Pokemon.
        Instead, either load a couple of Pokemon and add infinite scrolling functionality. Or, show some basic data for all Pokemon and add a "detail" view when the user clicks on a Pokemon.
Add lazy loading to the front end data and images.
More testing:
    Especially end to end
